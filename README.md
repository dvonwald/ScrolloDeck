## Description

-We wanted to create an app that gave the user game choices they can play with their friends depending on the user's search criteria.

-We learned how to build an entire application both front end and back end using mySQL and Sequelize ORM for the database. We deployed using Heroku. Node.js and Express.js were used to create a RESTful API. Handlebars.js was used as the template engine. Express-session and bcrypt were essential to the authentication on this app as well as capturing cookies.
